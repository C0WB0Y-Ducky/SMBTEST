# SMBTEST
  Only need to see permissions from SMB drives, but do not need the full functionality of smbmap? Have I got a bash script for you!
  Simply plug in the IP you want into the script, run and read the text file created!

# Requirements
  Smbclient needs to be installed for the script to run

# Usage
  ./smbtest.sh x.x.x.x

# Suggestions
  If you have any suggestions, additions, or comments about the code feel free to email me at cwbyducky@gmail.com

# Credit
  The Project was created due to not needing ShawnDEvans full smbmap.
  But just a quick check of Read/Write using bash.
